= Vert.x Jaeger Example

This project is an example Vert.x Application utilizing the OpenTracing API to obtain application performance monitoring with Jaeger.

== Prerequisites

* Docker
* Apache Maven
* JDK 8+

== Getting started

Start Docker daemon. 
----
$ systemctl start Docker
----

All-in-one is an executable designed for quick local testing, launches the Jaeger UI, collector, query, and agent, with an in memory storage component.

The simplest way to start the all-in-one is to use the pre-built image published to DockerHub (a single command line).

----
$ docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.7
----
See Jaeger Tracing link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.7/getting-started[Getting Started Guide] for more information.

After executing the docker run command navigate to http://localhost:16686 to access the Jaeger UI.

Create your project with:

[source]

----
git clone https://github.com/tjachja/Vertx_Jaeger_Example.git 
----

== Running the project

Once you have retrieved the project, you can check that everything works with:

[source]

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
mvn exec:java
----

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then  it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8083. You should see a _Hello World_ message.

== Anatomy of the project

The project contains:

* a `pom.xml` file
* a _main_ verticle file (src/main/java/io/vertx/starter/MainVerticle.java)
* an unit test (src/main/test/io/vertx/starter/MainVerticleTest.java)
